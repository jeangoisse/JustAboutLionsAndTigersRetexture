#### Just About Lions and Tigers (Continued) AI Retexture

As the title says, this is an HD retexture for this great xenotype mod. The original textures were 128px and kinda blurry. 

Now textures are upscaled to 256px + lossless compression to save memory.

Original mod texture folder size : 387ko

Retexture texture folder size : 1.05mo

This is quite decent for such an upscale I think. Impact on ram is minimal.

Tools used : waifu2x-GUI, pinga image compressor.
